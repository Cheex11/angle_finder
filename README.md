angle_finder
============
This was an exercise assigned to all Epicodus students who were interested in working at CrowdSupply.  
------------------------


The Assignment:
---------------
> Write a program that converts a time of day to angles (in degrees)
of the hour and minute hand from 12 moving clockwise on a standard
analog clock. Assume 12-hour time. For example: the input for midnight
would be 0, 0 and the output would be 0, 0. The input for 3PM would be
3, 0 and the output would be 90, 0. Use the programming language of
your choice.


My take:
---------
The page tells the angles of the clock and also lets users input their own time to figure out the angle at that time.


To Do:
------
> Disallow any number above 23 for the hour input or any number above 59 for the minute and seconds input
